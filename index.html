    <h1 class="gun-name">Hey, This is about the gaza/israeli war.</h1>

    <p style="font-size: 18px; font-family: sans-serif; line-height: 0.8cm;">For the people that support israel and the jews out here, do you think that killing is good?, if you do then i'd hope you experience the same traumatizing events that the kids/adults have experienced in palestine. In the past few months, israel have been killing innocent people in gaza with the excuse of "terrorists" but the fact is, they are not killing terrorists, they're killing everyone infront of them. Kids, women, and also men.
      Killing adult men to prevent them from breeding, killing kids for no future protesters against the occupation. in other words, a massacre, they cut the men's jewels, and even took people's organs, and they were mostly children, they used it on college tests which is disturbing and disgusting... the fact that people are making fun of the palestinians is showing you nothing but as a coward for the world, The fact that you are saying that they are trying to gain the world's attention is even worse. these people had no food or water or a place to sleep in for months.. For the people that are asking why they never fight back, the reason is because they dont have money for weapons, that means no army, the fact that they dont even kill most of the kids instead they shotgun their parent's head infront of them and then torturing them is even more savage... have you ever thought of not being a stupid coward who is scared of being jmped on by a bunch of losers who likes a country that killed millions of innocent people. The only thing i'd hope for you to do, is to fight against these people.
      Fight against the people that call 6 year old kids terrorists. fight the people that disrespected multiple religions. fight the people that took a land that they didnt deserve nor own.
      I hope this message helped you. 
    </p>
